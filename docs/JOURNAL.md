Break: Finish making inputs depend on mouse cursor pos, or perhaps add a key to switch between instances. Probably cursor pos is best for now.

Adding mouse tile cursor and then I'll start on procgen

Mouse cursor done, but now I realised I need to make local command work before it's confirmed by the server (and probably render it out)
